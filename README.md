Emu-Linq
========

Emu-Linq is an open source *emulation* of LINQ To Objects. As where `System.Linq` requires that you target at least version 3.5 of the .NET framework, EmuLinq only requires that you target at least version 2.

Understand that this framework was largely written for educational purposes but if you can find a use for this in your own projects then by all means, go ahead.
